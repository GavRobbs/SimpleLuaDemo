# SimpleLuaDemo

This demo demonstrates integrating Lua with C++ using the sol2 library. The version of Lua used is 5.4.7, and can be found in the external/lua folder.

Some sample scripts can be found in the Scripts folder, covering functionality such as displaying output and working with complex types fed in from C++, with additional functionality such as member functions, copy constructors and operator overloading.
